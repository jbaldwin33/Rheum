No install instructions

Open mainmenu.unity and credits.unity to see the main menu and credits respectively.

The font Gardiner was chosen because it replicated an Egyptian hieroglyphic style.
The font vsHandPrinted was chosen as the font used in our game logo because it gives off the feel we were trying to give off in our game - adventurous, creepy, but fun.

The button I wanted to replicate newer game's styles, but not too glossy because it is not a modern game.

I added a vignette on the menu/credit background to replicate the 'closed-eye' effect. Because our game title, Rheum, is named after the sand one finds after sleeping, I feel as if it was appropriate to add an effect that gives off this sleepy feeling.
